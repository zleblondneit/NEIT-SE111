            <h2>Review Of <em>Prisoners</em> (2013)</h2>


            <p><b>Zachary LeBlond</b>, <i>January 30th 2024</i></p>

            <P><em>Prisoners</em> as a movie tackles and extremely heavy topic, it handles itself extremely well with the controversy surrounding its theme. The actors in this movie did an outstanding job playing their respective characters and showing experession. The entire movie showcases the descent of Keller Dover and they could not have chosen any more qualified than Hugh Jackson. Detective Loki goes through his own trials and tribulations and Jake Gylenhall plays this role in spades. The entire film is based on suspense and without spoiling the film the movie wraps itself up in a beautiful crescendo, correctly closing all points displayed throughout the film. <em>Prisoners</em> is a movie I would give anything to watch for the first time and I highly reccomend it to anyone who is into anything in the crime genre. </P>
